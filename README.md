# Project Horus - HackMIT 2019
## Description
Project Horus is an application that reads paper and digital receipts with OCR to inform customers on their purchase decisions. Using a combination of machine learning algorithms, Project Horus scans, reads, parses, and analyzes in-depth semantics embedded in receipts. Currently, we run analytics on grocery receipts to inform consumers on the healthiness and unhealthiness of their food selections based on statistics from a nutritional facts database. In addition to serving as a personal finance tool, we are donating a percentage of the total value of healthy purchases in a month to a hunger-related charity. In the future, we plan to expand our technology to analyze receipts from other industries, including clothing, technology, wellness, education, and business applications.
